    <h2>What is MyCookBook about?</h2>
    <p>Cooking has always been my favourite thing to do! I like cooking and exploring new recipes. I also like to learn
        new recipes from others. I always try to do something new with the flavours and create a delicious dish
        possible! Here in MyCookBook I have shared few of my favourite recipes and also would love to know your
        experience trying them out! Also i would be more happy if you share your recipe ideas with me!</p>
    <p>MyCookBook is here to help you all with some really yummy, delicious and outstanding recipes. As it is truly said
        by Wolfgang Puck that “Cooking is like painting or writing a song. Just as there
        are only so many notes or colors, there are only so many flavors—it’s how you combine them that sets you apart.”
        The food should taste good, be easy in procedure and all the ingredients should be easily available at home are
        few major points that we always look up to whenever we provide any recipe on our page! </p>
